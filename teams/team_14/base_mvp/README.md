# Base MVP

This folder is where your project code lives.

## Phase 2: Design (One Person)

**One team member** creates the base MVP here. This is the foundation everyone else builds on.

### What to Build
- A minimal, working version of your project
- Should run locally and do *something* visible
- Keep it simple — 10 minutes max!

### Good Examples
- A Chrome extension with one button that does one thing
- A web page with basic HTML/CSS/JS
- A simple CLI script

### Instructions

1. Tell Cursor to read the `prd.md` in your team folder
2. Tell Cursor to generate the base MVP here
3. Tell Cursor to run it locally and verify it works

### After You're Done

> **Ask Cursor:** "Commit all my changes with the message '[Team] - Base MVP scaffold', push to my fork, and open a PR to the original repo"

Once the PR is merged, your teammates can build on top of it!
