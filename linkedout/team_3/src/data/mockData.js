    content: 'Thrilled to announce I\'m starting a new chapter! \n\nA little about me: I\'m one of a LOT of kids (yes, Irish Catholic, yes, we needed a scheduling algorithm for the bathroom). I got married at 22 because when you grow up in a house that loud, you learn to commit to things fast.\n\nWhat I lack in hair follicles I make up for in enthusiasm and sheer volume of dad jokes. The bald spot has been "building character" since 2018. My kids call it my solar panel for wisdom. I call it genetics and stress, in that order.\n\nIf I can survive Sunday dinners with that many siblings, a house where you had to book bathroom time, and the great Christmas Gift Exchange Spreadsheet Incident of 2019, I can survive anything.
