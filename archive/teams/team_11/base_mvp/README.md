# Base MVP — Sunny Day Weather

Minimal React (Vite) weather app. One main view: location, temperature (°C), and condition as text. Stub data only — no API.

## Run locally

```bash
cd teams/team_11/base_mvp
npm install   # once
npm run dev   # starts at http://localhost:5176
```

## What’s included (base only)

- **Vite + React** — runs with `npm run dev`
- **Stub data** — `src/data/weatherStub.js`: `location`, `temperature`, `condition`
- **One view** — current location name, temperature in one unit, condition as text
- **Simple weather card** — basic layout and styling

## Left for teammates

- **Jack** — Unit toggle (°C / °F)
- **Allegra** — Location selector (2–3 cities)
- **Hanna** — Condition icon (sun/cloud/rain)
- **Nini** — Extra stats card (feels like, humidity, wind)

## After you’re done

> **Ask Cursor:** "Commit all my changes with the message '[Team 11] - Base MVP scaffold', push to my fork, and open a PR to the original repo"

Once the PR is merged, teammates can build on top of it.
