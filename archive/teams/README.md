# Team Folders

Welcome to the SDLC Workshop!

## Claiming Your Team Folder

There are **20 team slots** available: `team_0` through `team_19`.

**Your team needs to claim one of these folders.**

### How to Claim

1. **Tell Cursor** to fork the workshop repo, clone your fork, and create a branch
2. Pick an unclaimed team number (coordinate with your team!)
3. **Tell Cursor** to add your team members to `teams/team_X/members/`
4. **Tell Cursor** to help fill out the PRD in your team folder
5. **Tell Cursor** to commit, push, and open a PR to the original repo

### ⚠️ Warning

Multiple teams might try to claim the same folder at the same time. If that happens... well, that's what merge conflicts are for! 

This is a learning experience. Good luck!

## Folder Structure

Each team folder contains:

```
teams/team_X/
├── base_mvp/                    # Your project code goes here
│   └── .gitkeep
├── github_command_cheatsheet.md # Git commands reference
├── members/                     # One file per team member
│   ├── alice.md
│   ├── bob.md
│   └── ...
└── prd.md                       # Your Product Requirements Document
```

## What's Already There

- **`prd.md`** — Instructions and template for your project specification. Fill this in!
- **`github_command_cheatsheet.md`** — Quick reference for all the git commands you'll need
- **`base_mvp/`** — Put your actual project code here
- **`members/`** — Each team member creates their own file here

## Member File Format

```markdown
# [Your Name]

**Role:** [AE/FE/ADM]
**GitHub:** [@your-username](https://github.com/your-username)
```

> **Don't know your GitHub username?** Ask Cursor to run `gh api user --jq .login` — it'll find it for you.
